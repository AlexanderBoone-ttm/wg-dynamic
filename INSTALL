Installation Makefile Target
============================

    # make install

This command takes into account several environment variables:

  * PREFIX               default: /usr
  * DESTDIR              default:
  * BINDIR               default: $(PREFIX)/bin
  * LIBDIR               default: $(PREFIX)/lib
  * MANDIR               default: $(PREFIX)/share/man
  * BASHCOMPDIR          default: $(PREFIX)/share/bash-completion/completions
  * RUNSTATEDIR          default: /var/run
  * PKG_CONFIG           default: pkg-config

  * WITH_BASHCOMPLETION  default: [auto-detect]

The first section is rather standard. The second section is not:

  * WITH_BASHCOMPLETION decides whether or not bash completion files for the
    tools are installed. This is just a nice thing for people who have bash.
    If you don't have bash, or don't want this, set the environment variable
    to `no'. If you'd like to force its use, even if bash-completion isn't
    detected in DESTDIR, then set it to `yes'.

If you're a simple `make && make install` kind of user, you can get away with
not setting these variables and relying on the auto-detection. However, if
you're writing a package for a distro, you'll want to explicitly set these,
depending on what you want.
